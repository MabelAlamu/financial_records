financial_script contains code that analyzes the financial records of a company. The financial data called budget_data.csv is composed of two columns 'Date' and 'Profit/Losses'. 

The financial_script calculates the following and saves the output as a csv file:

* The total number of months included in the dataset
  
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  
* Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
  
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
